## DynamicCam-Classic

This addon is a reiteration of my favorite addon for Retail WoW, DynamicCam. Originally curated by Mpstark and [can be found here](https://github.com/Mpstark/DynamicCam).

I'll be working on updating this as often as I can, please report any bugs you find as well as contribute if you can.

Thanks to the commentors [yoshimario40](https://www.curseforge.com/members/yoshimario40/) and [isecai](https://www.curseforge.com/members/isecai/) on CurseForge who had found and fixed some inital bugs that made it so the addon would work in the first place.
